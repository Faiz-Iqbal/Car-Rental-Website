                    <dt><strong>STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR CAR:</strong></dt>
                    <dd> We recommend that you choose from the website's
                        list of cheapest deals, as this contains our best value, most readily available models.
                        Alternatively, we can find you a vehicle if you contact any of our agents.</dd>
                    <hr>
                    <dt><strong>STEP 2: FILL IN AN ONLINE PROPOSAL:</strong></dt>
                    <dd> You can fill an online proposal
                        form here on the website. Because the proposal form contains so much information
                        which you may have to look up, it is fully protected on a secure server and security
                        certificate. </dd>
                    <hr>
                    <dt><strong>STEP 3: SEND THE PROPOSAL FORM TO ME:</strong></dt>
                    <dd> When you have made sure you have completed all the information
                        on the proposal form, press the submit button on the online form, or scan and email it. We may
                        require from business customers a copy of your latest accounts or P&L and balance sheet for the
                        benefit of the finance company (it depends on several factors such as credit scoring, number of
                        years
                        trading, etc). From private customers, maybe we need a recent gas/water/electric bill, or bank
                        statement
                        to prove address, to prevent identity fraud. You will always need a copy of your full UK Driving
                        Licence,
                        or passport. We also use several other security measures. We have never had a case of data
                        theft.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>STEP 4: WAIT FOR AN ORDER FORM, THEN SIGN IT: </strong></dt>
                    <dd> When finance approval has been completed,
                        we will email you an order form for your car. A signed order form commits you to ordering the
                        car.
                        Check it, print it, sign it, indicate your colour choice, then scan/email it back to us. We will
                        then
                        confirm and order the car and confirm the lead time.</dd>
                    <hr>
                    <dt><strong>STEP 5: SIGN FINANCE DOCUMENTS AND WAIT FOR THE DELIVER OF YOUR CAR:</strong></dt>
                    <dd> Usually, we will post
                        (for security reasons) documents to be signed before delivery of your car. These need to be
                        completed and returned,
                        swiftly, usually together with the initial payment. Occasionally, we will arrange delivery of
                        your car with finance
                        documents to be signed at the same time, but this is not typical. More proofs may be required.
                        All this is to
                        protect your identity. Delivery is free, usually to your home or work address, whichever is most
                        convenient.</dd>
                    <hr>
                    <dt><strong>STEP 6: ENJOY YOUR CAR: </strong></dt>
                    <dd> You need to insure your car, but anyone you choose can drive it.
                        Treat it as you would treat your own personal car. You have full UK manufacturer's warranty and
                        whatever
                        breakdown cover the manufacturer applies. Usually, servicing is your own responsibility. With
                        all the
                        money you have saved, book yourself a nice expensive holiday, or buy a diamond ring!</dd>
                    <hr>
                    <dt><strong>STEP 7:PREPARE FOR, THEN RETURN YOUR CAR AT THE END OF CONTRACT:</strong></dt>
                    <dd> Simply, your car needs to
                        be in a condition commensurate with its age and mileage. This is common sense. A useful guide
                        is available in PDF format to read/print here. You just hand the car back. It is collected
                        directly from you at your address.</dd>
